# Wrangler-Project---UK-based-online-retail-store
In this project, I will be working with the Online Retail Data Set from Kaggle (uploaded by vijayuv) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayuv/onlineretail. 🛒

This dataset contains transactional records from a UK-based online retail store, including:

- 🧾 InvoiceNo – transaction ID

- 📦 StockCode – product code

- 📝 Description – product description

- 🔢 Quantity – number of items

- 💲 UnitPrice – price per item

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 CustomerID – unique customer identifier

- 🌍 Country – customer location

👉 The main goal here is not deep analysis, but rather data wrangling 🔧:

- 🧐 Inspect the raw data structure

- 🧹 Handle missing values & duplicates

- ⏳ Correct data types

- ✍️ Clean inconsistencies in product descriptions and customer IDs

- 📂 Prepare a clean dataset ready for analysis

✨ By the end of this process, we’ll have a consistent, reliable, and tidy dataset that can be used for further exploration and analytics.
